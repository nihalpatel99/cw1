Yes the phone has shutter lag but that means the photo is taken slighty later then the moment you actually press the shutter button- nevertheless the picture shouldnt be blurry. The bluriness comes from Samsungs bad algorithm not noticing a moving Objekct and therefore not using fast enough shutter speed on the picture

Also, I think there are settings either in the RAW mode or the camera app that speed up the aperture for fast action sequences.

If it&#39;s motionless when you press the button but moves as you are snapping, it will have a lower shutter speed, hence the blur.  Also, I understand wanting flagship sound from your speakers but there are limits.  My car pumps 100 rms into focal flax speakers and 500 watts rms into my subwoofer equipped with a passive radiator, all through a dedicated sound processor and it sounds excellent.  But my home system blows the car out of the water with it&#39;s sound.  Expecting a tiny device with pinhole, microscopic speakers to sound anything approaching good might be a straight run to disappointment.  Great review overall, thanks."

I used to have a iphone work phone so I would always compare the both and the thing that kept me away from apple was that after you pay all this money for a phone apple then tells you that you can only use it&#39;s technology if it&#39;s an apple product. Casting to tv is then out unless it&#39;s an apple tv. Samsung on the other hand will give you 99% control of other technology even if it&#39;s not samsung. Simple.

The most business oriented professional work phone. I&#39;ve had times at the airport or standing in a bus where I made full on presentations on my note. I extensively used the note for reading and annotating my thoughts using the s pen and that&#39;s where the core strengths of this device lies. Which is also why it&#39;s so much more expensive as well. Because serves not only as the iPhone Pro Max rival but also the rival of an iPad Mini WITH an apple pencil.<br><br>Edit:  I&#39;m upgrading to this one. Already preordered it.

Not everything you purchase or your preferences are perfect.  Personally I probably use one of the AI features on there and the rest is pointless to have because I used others google app for it anyway.  I would love Samsung to copy the &quot;Voice to Text&quot; features like the one on the pixel phone.  It is so great to use your voice to text.  All androids have it but the pixel takes it to another level.  It allows to correct mistakes without having to touch the keyboard.

There is big thread in Samsung&#39;s own community forum. Android authority also has 2 articles mention this problem. There is no fix to this problem even you change from Natural to vivi profile under screen mode of the display settings. As of your major reviewer should mention about this.

I&#39;m coming from an Mi 11 Ultra and I thought that phone&#39;s camera was bad. But, after using the new phone, I&#39;ve changed my mind. The videos with all the lenses were noisy and soft indoors. The photos were OVERsharpened, and had a lot of noise reduction. <br><br>The RAW photos were - well RAW photos. It lacked dynamic range. I&#39;d seen much more dynamic range in RAW files from the GCAM apps. In my previous phone, I could easily use photos at 1600, 3200, etc ISO and fix them in post. But, the ones from Pro mode in S24 Ultra were really bad and I had to crank up my noise reduction to the mid. (I know I&#39;m kind of a pixel peeper)<br><br>I also tried the Expert RAW app, which supposedly gives you best RAW photos from Samsung phones. In my experience, it was the worst experience editing the RAW files. A simple bump in shadows and everything turned green.

If it is an Ai feature that can execute every tedious or repetitive task effective on your phone just by using your voice then it can be a worthy service to buy. It appears that people are complaining about the additional cost which shows that we need to revised and upgrade every utility to compel people to take on another expense or bill. We need to add utilities that will add benefits to facilitate saving money for users. I quess people want to save money not to lose money which is a complicated task to solve."

Even before when I had the Note 3. Would a larger battery be nice? Sure, but the amount of times I have been thankful for the added functionality that little pen gives in my opinion outweighs it. The s-pen being on the left side is a tad interesting though as it is on the right side (the side you said it should be on) on my phone. Time and time again I have thought about switching to Apple and narrowing down the amount of ecosystems I deal with as my career field is still dominated by Apple products but the fact that the pro max phones still don&#39;t have some sort of apple pencil (perhaps an apple pencil mini?) for them yet has been a huge holdup for me."

I dont see any reasons to upgrade tbh. Think im going to wait for S25  because of the custom chip and camera improvements as all i care about is a fast phone that can handle many multiple resource intensive apps at once AND I take tons of photos and videos that i edit... so i need a great camera and great chip... hence next phone should blow this one out of the water and blow my s21u away"
