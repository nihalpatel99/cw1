4,All the S23 Ultra needs is updates to improve colours &amp; skintones. The S24U is fine for people upgrading from the S22 series and below. Not a significant uograde on the S23U.,positive,positive

8,I think nowadays people miss out the entire point of s24 ultra. The phone was the replacement of Note series. The most business oriented professional work phone. I&#39;ve had times at the airport or standing in a bus where I made full on presentations on my note. I extensively used the note for reading and annotating my thoughts using the s pen and that&#39;s where the core strengths of this device lies. Which is also why it&#39;s so much more expensive as well. Because serves not only as the iPhone Pro Max rival but also the rival of an iPad Mini WITH an apple pencil.<br><br>Edit:  I&#39;m upgrading to this one. Already preordered it. Upgrading from my old note 8. Can&#39;t wait to see the gains.,positive,positive
9,"There is a setting to make the camera faster. Go to camera settings and there is a feature where it analysis the scene and enhances the image...

22,"Ultra man!<br>The reason I finally upgraded my old Samsung to this S24 ultra was it finally felt worthy of it! <br>The thing that keeps me with Samsung is that you can do the Samsung ecosystem, but you&#39;re not tied to it like with apple because it&#39;s universal. That&#39;s the selling point for me.",positive,positive
23,"I&#39;m upgrading this year from an S20 plus after the most recent update probably broke my screen with a green line. I was torn between the S23U, fhe S24U snd the Pixel 8 Pro so this video really helped me lock down my decision to get the S23U. Thanks!",positive,positive

25,"The S Pen has been around since the 1st note.  Saying it debuted with the S22U is misleading to say the least as a name change doesn&#39;t remove the fact that todays ultra device is nothing more than a rebadged Note device.  Regardless, Note/ Ultra devices have consistently been the best devices out since the Note 10 era if you prefer productivity over bubble color.",positive,positive

30,"Well worth the pricing for the S24 ultra. Samsung has alway had an amazing trade in policy, which makes it well worth it. The features you cannot beat compare. Yes, maybe with the next update there will be more AI features. Samsung listens to their consumers. Happy that it is a flat screen this time around!! Can‚Äôt wait to find out more from Samsung.",positive,positive
31,"I thought it was a good idea to upgrade because i had the S23 u 500 gb with only 100 gb left and the 1TB S24 U was on $600 after trade in and i got a free pair of Buds 2 pro. Now that i have it im SUPER happy i upgraded, its NIIIIICE! ü§©",positive,positive
32,What about sound quality of s24 ultra. Even my s22 ultra is louder than s24 ultra. Is there anyone facing the same issue or my s24 ultra has some issue,positive,positive
33,"I purchased the s24 ultra last week, I have sold my iphone 15 pro max and apple watch ultra. I was stuck in the apple eco system but have now escaped I still have my m3 mac and ipad pro. the samsung phone has so many more feature and way more custimisable glad I made the move !",positive,positive
34,"The S23 Ultra is the best Android phone released this year.The Samsung folding phones may look cool, but if you keep a phone for 2/3 years would they survive general wear and tear? At the end of the day the Ultra has much better cameras and the brilliant S Pen built <a href=""http://in.plus/"">in.Plus</a> no crease in the middle of a great screen.",positive,positive
35,Nice review.  Brought up a lot of good points that I haven&#39;t seen it brought up elsewhere!,positive,positive
36,"For anybody that&#39;s thinking about the S24 Ultra, there is a display issue going on. It&#39;s dull and looks washed out.  I just got mine yesterday and i upgraded from the S21 Ultra and the S21 ultra screen looked a million times better! There&#39;s speculation there is an &quot;update&quot; coming Jan 31st but we&#39;ll see.  I&#39;ll hold off on getting the 24U  until it&#39;s fixed because it&#39;s depressing looking at the screen at times when my 21U looks flawless! If they don&#39;t fix this issue, I&#39;ll be getting the 23U also",positive,positive
37,"Samsung only did one thing that the people asked for, which was to make the ultra with a flat screen, but didn&#39;t make the selfie camera hidden under the display along with making the screen a 144hz refresh rate and giving it a 16 gig ram. I mean, even the s21 ultra came with 16 gig ram and were in 2024 it should DEFINITELY automatically come with a 16 gig ram. They also are going backward in charging capabilities. It should come with 65w fast charging automatically. For the price, it&#39;s just unnecessary.",negative,positive

39,"hands down THE best and most HONEST comparison review yet! I feel like the TOP tech Youtubers are now a SELL OUT pushing the new S24U and not showing any honest downsides of the phone including  MKBHD and WhosMrBoss!<br>I sold off my S22U to prep up n buy the S24u I&#39;m glad it wasn&#39;t available till now on prebooking! I moved to Iphone 15pro max for the time being! and as a major content consumer like  YT, Netflix and Twitch on my phone I HATED Iphones display and dull colors! literally ZERO vibrancy, so I decided to move back to Samsung n planned to buy S24u NOT until I saw this review about the new Armor glass and how it kills vibrancy, this is a MAJOR deal for me to have good colors which is why I missed Super amoled! Now I will be switching back to S23U and saving some money! <br>AGIAN THANK YOU for this Honest review! @Matthew",positive,positive

45,"Is this a worthy upgrade from s21 ultra?  My main reason for upgrading is a flat screen.  S21 is still a beast but I really dont like its curved edges.  But I mean other than that, is it worth it?",positive,positive
46,Got mine 2 days ago the camera is just mind blowing.,neutral,positive
47,Awesome video! One thing i noticed: the blurry photos of slightly moving animals etc dont cone from shutter lag. Yes the phone has shutter lag but that means the photo is taken slighty later then the moment you actually press the shutter button- nevertheless the picture shouldnt be blurry. The bluriness comes from Samsungs bad algorithm not noticing a moving Objekct and therefore not using fast enough shutter speed on the picture,positive,positive
48,Went to Samsung store and compared my S23 ultra with S24 ultra.<br>1. Didn&#39;t find the screen as smooth and attractive as s23 ultra<br>2. Somehow I like the curve in s23 ultra as it gives smooth gesture swiping feeling when using back swipe. No swipe back in Iphone so flat screen makes no difference there<br>3. 10x was ok but 100x was really bad in s24 ultra when compared with s23 ultra.<br>4. AI is all gimmick which I personally think is in its nascent stage and people may not be using it. future may be different.<br>but yes the interface seemed smooth in S24 display piece.,positive,positive
49,I normally dislike purple/violet but think the Titanium Violet looks pretty great with the contrasting titanium sides. It looks a bit like midnight blue to me.,positive,positive

52,I just don&#39;t understand why the ultra didn&#39;t have the same exact body as the 24 and s24 plus üò≠üò≠.. Literally had to go s24 plus because of the body alone. I have a s22 ultra and i love it but the corners poke to much and i always hated the corners. I was literally going to buy an iphone for the very first time due to the comfortability and thank God sammy made a phone with iphone body which i love alot.,positive,positive
53,Great video. And you brought up great points about the shutter lag with camera. It&#39;s been an issue for a long time.,positive,positive
54,"I have a question if anybody can answer it, I would greatly appreciate it.  I have the Samsung Galaxy Note 10+.  I love the Note, but I would like to upgrade to the Samsung Galaxy S24 Ultra.  I bought the Note 10+ in 2019. I am trading it in for the S24 Ultra.  Is it worth upgrading.  What&#39;s your opinion?",positive,positive
55,"Thank you for the caveat at the beginning about not missing out by not upgrading to the newest phone.  So many videos are created in such a way as to create anxiety in people about their current phone and wanting the new one, especially younger people.  I hate that about some tech reviews.  So it&#39;s nice to hear an influential reviewer say something different and a little more sensible.",positive,positive

62,You truly have the best review videos. I was an avid Samsung user until 2019 and have used an iPhone since 2019. Might switch to s24 Ultra. <br><br>Love from Korea.,positive,positive
63,I will not be watching this. This guy has always been Iphone fan. I find his Reviews more like a discreet advertisement for the iPhone. The iPhone is not the best phone and has not been for many years. How ever apple are the best sales team in the world . USA are the best in world when it comes to sales and advertising.  Look coco cola hamburger  junk. If you want the best designers in the world you go to Italy Lamborghini Maserati Ferrari if you want the best engineers in the world you got a Germany. After all the germans put the first man on the moon in the 60s and Americans paid for it.üòÇ,positive,positive

66,Thanks for the thorough review! I&#39;m upgrading from an S22 Ultra so I think it&#39;s going to rock!,positive,positive
67,I‚Äôm on the fence because I just got it and I really hate the colors of the display. Not sure if I want to keep it. It should be better in every way than the previous year. We shouldn‚Äôt have to compensate for a $1500 phone. I‚Äôm liking my 23 better at this point.,negative,positive

77,I ordered the Samsung s24 ultra titanium green .  Love the mint green colour and it looks awesome. .<br>The day later the pixel 8 pro brings one out.,positive,positive
78,I still think Samsung should make the S24 plus series a smaller version of the S24 Ultra. Same as what they did with the note 10 and note 10 plus. Keep it the same size as the plus model or slightly smaller? Couldn‚Äôt hurt,neutral,positive
79,Love the review.  I buy Samsung and I like hearing the criticisms sometimes.  Not everything you purchase or your preferences are perfect.  Personally I probably use one of the AI features on there and the rest is pointless to have because I used others google app for it anyway.  I would love Samsung to copy the &quot;Voice to Text&quot; features like the one on the pixel phone.  It is so great to use your voice to text.  All androids have it but the pixel takes it to another level.  It allows to correct mistakes without having to touch the keyboard.,positive,positive
80,I UPGRADED LOL ITS WORTH IT. I HAD A NOTE 20 5G WITH NO ISSUES BUT THE AI UPGRADES WERE THE SELLING POINTS FOR ME,positive,positive
81,I have an S20 with screen burn in and the battery life is pretty poor even with a replacement battery. I think I will either get a S24 and keep it for 3+ years or buy a used Fold 3 to hold me over until the S25.,negative,positive
82,I have to upgrade after 4 years with my 20+. And needing DEX this was the choice I made. Ain&#39;t nobody paying full price for this phone though... Like do a little research.,positive,positive

85,"Are you absolutely out of your mind? You would have LIKED it that the Ultra would have something exclusive? Are you crazy??? GATEKEEPING IS BAD. My god. Praise them for it. You can now choose the phone you actually WANT instead of having to worry you miss out of stuff. You want a better camera? Go with the more expensive one. Want a pen, go for the Ultra. But all of them are good enough to use ALL the features. You pay for HARDWARE this time, not software. This is a GOOD direction!",positive,positive
86,"Reviewers have not mentioned that Samsung, direct and via carrier partners, is giving $650 on the trade of an S22 Ultra, effectively bringing the cost of the phone down to $650 along with $100/$200 in credit towards accessories. If you trade an S23 Ultra they give $750.  So that cost versus feature analysis should be revisited.",positive,positive

97,"Got my S24 Ultra today and I&#39;m super disappointed with the cameras. I&#39;m coming from an Mi 11 Ultra and I thought that phone&#39;s camera was bad. But, after using the new phone, I&#39;ve changed my mind. The videos with all the lenses were noisy and soft indoors. The photos were OVERsharpened, and had a lot of noise reduction. <br><br>The RAW photos were - well RAW photos. It lacked dynamic range. I&#39;d seen much more dynamic range in RAW files from the GCAM apps. In my previous phone, I could easily use photos at 1600, 3200, etc ISO and fix them in post. But, the ones from Pro mode in S24 Ultra were really bad and I had to crank up my noise reduction to the mid. (I know I&#39;m kind of a pixel peeper)<br><br>I also tried the Expert RAW app, which supposedly gives you best RAW photos from Samsung phones. In my experience, it was the worst experience editing the RAW files. A simple bump in shadows and everything turned green. A bit of research showed me that the Expert RAW app just gives you a JPEG in a DNG file. I have no idea why Samsung chose this, but it&#39;s just a JPEG at that point. <br><br>I really liked the phonee, but imma return this.",negative,positive

But if you compare vivid mode on the ultra and vivid on the s24+,  the plus model looks bette, vibrant and brighter. Even in 2k and full hd+. And because of this i think it is  a software thing and not something with the coating. But im not a engineer so who knows.<br> So i would suggest just use Standard mode if you have a ultra untill they fix it.

The s24+ has some things i&#39;m not really happy with that i HOPE are fixed with software updates but outwith that it&#39;s an impressive phone even if it does have an exynos chip.

If it&#39;s motionless when you press the button but moves as you are snapping, it will have a lower shutter speed, hence the blur.  Also, I understand wanting flagship sound from your speakers but there are limits.  My car pumps 100 rms into focal flax speakers and 500 watts rms into my subwoofer equipped with a passive radiator, all through a dedicated sound processor and it sounds excellent.

566,I&#39;ve been a samsung fan for the longest. I used to have a iphone work phone so I would always compare the both and the thing that kept me away from apple was that after you pay all this money for a phone apple then tells you that you can only use it&#39;s technology if it&#39;s an apple product. Casting to tv is then out unless it&#39;s an apple tv. Samsung on the other hand will give you 99% control of other technology even if it&#39;s not samsung. Simple.,negative,positive
